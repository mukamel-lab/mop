MoP
================

The Multiomics Processing (MoP) package is a collection of functions and wrappers
used by the Mukamel group for the analysis of transcriptomic and epigenomic data. At the
moment MoP is just a collection of functions, but over time it will be packaged into a more
user-friendly configuration. The majority of these functions are designed to work with
data stored in the `loom <http://loompy.org/>`_ file format.

Requirements
------------
* python 3
* loompy
* numpy
* pandas
* scipy
* scikit-learn
* annoy
* MulticoreTSNE
* louvain
* python-igraph

Installation
------------
The only way to install MoP is by cloning the GitHub repository. Enter the directory
where you would like to download the repository and enter the following commands on
the command line::

    git clone https://github.com/mukamel-lab/mop.git
    cd mop
    python setup.py install

There are some reported issues when running setup.py install related to the installation
of some dependencies. If you are using a conda environment the best way to solve these
issues is to follow our `guide <docs/mop_conda_guide.rst>`_.

Tutorials and FAQs
